# MyShopLoader

Easily create a shop system without typing a lot of code with myShopLoader. mSL will process everything you enter in the configuration file, then turn it into a form UI shop. Starting in version 2.0 you can create unlimited shop categories.

# How to get started?

First of all, download and install myShopLoader to your Minecraft. Then create a world and activate the [Beta API](https://abcdavk.github.io/install.html#6-enable-experimental-features). Click the "Create world" button.
