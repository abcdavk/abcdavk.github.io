# 🚀 Install Minecraft Bedrock Mods

There are several ways to install Minecraft Bedrock Mods, I would recommend using the `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` format, because this way the mod will be immediately installed in your Minecraft with just one click.

## Quick Installation steps

### 1. Open your File Manager.
