# 🚀 Install Minecraft Bedrock Mods

There are several ways to install Minecraft Bedrock Mods, I would recommend using the `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` format, because this way the mod will be immediately installed in your Minecraft with just one click.

## Quick Installation steps:

1. Open your File Manager.

3. Wait a seconds until the mods already installed.
4. Create a new world.
5. Active the behavior packs and/or resource pack.
6. Enable experimental settings.
